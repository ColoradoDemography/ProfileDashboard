History:
12/6/2017 First Demo version (0.4) shows sample topic and page layout and outputs a rough PDF report.  
          Still investigating PDF output strategies.  I want to avoid Pandoc, but not sure if I can.
          
2/5/2018  Full demo verion (1.0) with working interface and draft PDF output.  Currently outputs county level plots and data. 
          This version uses Pandoc and tinytex.  removed references to RobR.  Building docker interface.  V1.0 testing period: 2/5-19/2018

# ProfileDashboard
Development of SDO Profile Dashboard

The project produces a Shiny dashboard to facilitate the production of Community Profiles for State Demography Office users.
development is in the early stages.

History:
12/6/2017 First Demo version (0.4) shows sample topic and page layout and outputs a rough PDF report.  
          Still investigating PDF output strategies.  I want to avoid Pandoc, but not sure if I can.
